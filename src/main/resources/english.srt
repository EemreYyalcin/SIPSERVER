1
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,590
Uhmm...

2
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:19,591
I know you're awake.

3
00:01:23,715 --> 00:01:25,715
Look at them.

4
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:27,739
Look at them very carefully.

5
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:34,587
Every single one of those faces
and remember them dearly.

6
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:38,511
Because tomorrow,
you're paying the devil's due.

7
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:42,559
Tomorrow you're heading straight
against the wall.

8
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,659
What a speech!

9
00:01:48,883 --> 00:01:51,883
I'm very touched.

10
00:01:52,807 --> 00:01:55,307
I said, look at those photos!

11
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:59,383
You don't know what I sacrificed
to finally catch you.

12
00:01:59,408 --> 00:02:03,079
Sacrifice?

13
00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:06,955
The door swings
both ways my friend.

14
00:04:54,554 --> 00:04:56,554
My friend.

15
00:04:56,778 --> 00:05:00,978
All the sacrifice...

16
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:11,302
Is all for...

17
00:05:11,426 --> 00:05:13,426
nothing!

18
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,286
Take the guns.

19
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:28,522
You're all free now.

20
00:05:28,547 --> 00:05:29,547
Okay?

21
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:48,875
Here.

22
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,540
Thank you, boss.

23
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,878
Now, this is a real gun.

24
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:01,958
What the fuck?

25
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,463
(TWO MONTHS LATER)

26
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:58,462
Sorry, the sutures aren't that great.

27
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,713
Who did this to you?

28
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,250
And who are you?

29
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,038
That will work.

30
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,830
I'm sorry. I didn't want to do this.

31
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,080
Excuse me...

32
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,375
Miss?

33
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,290
Where am I?

34
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,913
You're in a hospital.

35
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:36,654
You've been here for a while.

36
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,538
Any relatives? Family?

37
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,710
How about your name?

38
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:50,542
Patient data Ishmael

39
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,625
Ish...

40
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,287
Ishmael.

41
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:02,422
What about your real name?

42
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:18,042
Be right back.

43
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,575
Everything will be all right.

44
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:46,599
I'm sorry.

45
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,673
Ishmael, you can get up now.

46
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,043
What's this for?

47
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,633
It's just a precaution.

48
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:28,667
Thanks, doctor.

49
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,210
You can call me Ailin.

50
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,080
Anyway, let's get you dressed.

51
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,670
What's wrong, doctor? Tired?

52
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:18,827
Nothing, nothing. Let's go.

53
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:58,292
So, do you remember anything?

54
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,960
I see shadows.

55
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:10,957
But nothing feels familiar.

56
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:17,997
Look.

57
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:21,957
Just over there.
That's where Romli found you.

58
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,753
That's him right there, Romli.

59
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:33,752
It's him you should be grateful to.

60
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,415
Don't be so tense.

61
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,170
Now let's eat. I'm starving.

62
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,293
Where is he, huh?

63
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:11,132
Patience, boss.

64
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:14,247
It won't be long now.

65
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,250
That's it, I'm out of here.

66
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:24,524
Hold on...

67
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:41,423
Patience. It's the essence of success.

68
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,380
Please, sit. Sit down.

69
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:03,082
Okay, then. I'm digging in.

70
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,628
Now, this is tasty.

71
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,583
Want some?

72
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:34,547
Okay, Mr. Lee.

73
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:38,955
I respect you.
So, I'll get straight to the point.

74
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,133
I'm cutting you loose.

75
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,708
Come again?

76
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:52,787
Your guns... Chinese junk.

77
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,333
And this...

78
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,375
Diluted crap.

79
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:05,575
I wanted to do business with you
because of your reputation.

80
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,378
Lee, the sea devil.

81
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:19,128
Lee, the father from hell.

82
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,290
You see, getting rid of you
will give me a certain reputation, too.

83
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:34,828
Why would I bring all these people
just for a meeting with you?

84
00:20:39,052 --> 00:20:43,052
So, that's why you
bring all this people.

85
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:45,876
And the people outside.

86
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,375
I'll handle this.

87
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:49,287
He's... he's...

88
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:52,811
He's not my boss.

89
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,960
Chinese junk, huh?

90
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,125
The gun is good.

91
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:15,253
No, no, no. Wait, wait a second, bro...
I mean, boss.

92
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:18,293
Wait, wait, wait...

93
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,325
I got information. Important information.

94
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:23,673
For you.

95
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,960
The day you escaped.

96
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,580
They found a man by the beach,
brought him to hospital.

97
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:38,287
My point is, I heard
that he was very close to you.

98
00:24:54,808 --> 00:24:56,808
You fuckin' with me boy?!

99
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:59,793
Not there, please.

100
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,625
I'm not bullshitting.
I gave you information.

101
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:07,128
Please! I swear!

102
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,250
Please. Please. Please, don't kill me.

103
00:25:20,617 --> 00:25:23,458
Please, please.
Give me a chance.

104
00:25:23,483 --> 00:25:25,271
Okay. One chance.

105
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,420
Okay. I'm leaving now.

106
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,625
Fuck!

107
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:42,343
Now you can go to the
hospital and check it out?

108
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:43,417
Fuck.

109
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,290
Why the fuck do I have to wait?

110
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,825
Just get the damn doctor.
Bring him here.

111
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:38,878
Fix my ear, and you'll be done.
It's that simple.

112
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:41,578
Please, sir.
You're scaring the other patients.

113
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:45,917
You got eyes, right? Use your eyes.
Look at my ear. Look!

114
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:49,417
Call the doctor. And fix my fucking ear!

115
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,040
Sir, please,
you still need to fill out the form.

116
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:55,375
What the fuck? Are you kidding me?

117
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:58,040
Got a death wish, honey?

118
00:26:58,065 --> 00:26:59,479
Sir, just calm down.

119
00:27:00,042 --> 00:27:01,502
What did you say?

120
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:03,253
I said, calm down, sir.

121
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,138
Still can't hear.

122
00:27:04,163 --> 00:27:05,163
This is a hospi...

123
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,425
shut the fuck up!

124
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,450
Sir!

125
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:12,963
Please calm down.

126
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,920
Shit.

127
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:20,125
It hurts like hell, doc.

128
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:25,458
Doc.

129
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:30,078
I heard they found a dying guy
down by the beach.

130
00:27:30,167 --> 00:27:34,037
- Tilt up.
- And they brought him here.

131
00:27:37,167 --> 00:27:38,627
I see a lot of patients.

132
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:45,168
So, you're not denying it.
The beach boy was here.

133
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:48,327
You're hiding something, aren't you?

134
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:53,207
Yeah. Sto...

135
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,830
We're done. You can go now.

136
00:27:55,917 --> 00:27:56,559
About time.

137
00:27:56,584 --> 00:27:57,584
Thank you.

138
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:03,213
Can't just leave me high and dry, doctor.

139
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,383
Where is he?

140
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:09,668
I'll call security.

141
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,383
Go ahead, go for it.

142
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:18,292
Security!

143
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,580
Security.

144
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:27,955
Now look at me. Over here.

145
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:32,285
Quit the fucking games

146
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,960
and tell me where he is.

147
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,960
Unless you want
to play games with me.

148
00:28:47,917 --> 00:28:50,497
What the fuck?! Let me go!

149
00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:57,962
Doc, are you all right?

150
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:03,582
Ishmael!

151
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:06,792
Take that, you fuck.

152
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:09,705
Ishmael. Are you okay? Ishmael.

153
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,327
Ishmael, are you okay?

154
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:46,708
Ishmael.

155
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,330
Did you recognize that guy?

156
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:25,165
Your reaction earlier had me worried.

157
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:30,082
It could be dangerous for you
to stay here.

158
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:33,582
Maybe it's better for you
to come with me to Jakarta?

159
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,333
Jakarta?

160
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:40,173
I'll show you something.

161
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,460
We found foreign particles
in your skull,

162
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:48,172
right by the hippocampus area,
and we couldn't extract them.

163
00:30:48,292 --> 00:30:50,882
That's why I want you
to come with me to Jakarta.

164
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:55,875
They have better facilities
to remove them from your head.

165
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:01,955
Ishmael?

166
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,285
Ishmael?

167
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:09,208
Yes.

168
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:10,747
What say you?

169
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:20,707
What if I'm not a good person?
Would you still be there for me?

170
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:28,168
Ishmael, you're not a bad person.

171
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:30,712
That's why I need to find out who I am.

172
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:41,293
I promise, whatever happens...
We will meet again.

173
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:54,325
Here. Take it.

174
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,330
There's only one number on it.

175
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:10,205
After you find yourself,

176
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:12,543
look me up in Jakarta.

177
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:16,577
Bet you've never experienced
a real traffic jam before.

178
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:22,792
And if I become a successful doctor,

179
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:25,747
don't expect free checkups.

180
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:35,633
Don't...

181
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,460
Relax. Take it easy.

182
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:44,495
I won't abandon you.

183
00:33:00,917 --> 00:33:04,827
I'll show you again.
These are your x-rays.

184
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,130
The particles went into your head...

185
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:20,875
Ishmael.

186
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:22,632
Ishmael.

187
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:26,325
Another episode? Ishmael?

188
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:32,382
Are you okay?

189
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:35,167
Sorry.

190
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:40,458
It's nothing. I'm okay.

191
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:53,917
Going to the ferry station,
ready for departure.

192
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:56,248
That's my ride.

193
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:24,003
Fuck!

194
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:26,333
Thank you, sir. See you later.

195
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,880
Over here. Here, kid!

196
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,378
Why so sad?

197
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:48,042
Get over here.

198
00:35:29,792 --> 00:35:31,832
What's going on here?

199
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:42,922
What's the matter?

200
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,875
Where is he?

201
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:04,827
Abdi?

202
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Abdi?

203
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:11,875
Where is he?!

204
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:21,708
Ailin?

205
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:25,633
- Ishmael. Ishmael.
- Ailin? Ailin?

206
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:27,418
- They shot the driver.
- Where are you?!

207
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:14,333
Mommy.

208
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:16,752
Mommy.

209
00:37:19,292 --> 00:37:20,462
Mommy.

210
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,040
Mommy.

211
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:24,748
Wake up, mommy.

212
00:37:26,292 --> 00:37:27,632
Little girl.

213
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:29,875
Don't be sad.

214
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,245
Mommy is with god now.

215
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:46,878
Wait, wait, wait...

216
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:53,787
Where's abdi?

217
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:56,633
Abdi? Who?

218
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:01,458
Wait, wait, wait.
Your friend from the hospital.

219
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,833
He isn't here. He never left.

220
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:37,328
What is it now?
Try hitting the pedals.

221
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:43,003
Hey, hey, hey. Wait, damn it.
Where are you off to? Wait a sec.

222
00:38:58,625 --> 00:38:59,625
Ailin!

223
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:37,542
Ailin.

224
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:54,958
Ailin.

225
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:56,917
Ailin.

226
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:02,958
Damn. Smells like shit.

227
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:05,078
Burn the bus, he said.

228
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:07,168
It stinks!

229
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:09,827
Sucks to be you.

230
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:11,457
Pass me the gasoline!

231
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:16,500
It's coming. Chop them up first
so they'll burn easier.

232
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:25,915
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm just looking for a friend.

233
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:29,293
- Really?
- Yes.

234
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:31,497
Is this your friend?

235
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:44,083
Shit.

236
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:55,998
What the fuck?!

237
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:52,957
Hey, hey, hey.

238
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:50,833
Go fucking die! Go die!

239
00:42:50,917 --> 00:42:52,037
Fuck you!

240
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,250
Sir!

241
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:16,083
Sir!

242
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:19,000
Hang in there, sir.

243
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:20,713
Relax, kid. Easy now.

244
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:24,632
Please, sir. Sir! Just hang in there.

245
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,500
Sir!

246
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:40,583
Get him.

247
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:13,747
Damn.

248
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:16,672
What the fuck is this place?

249
00:45:17,667 --> 00:45:18,877
Damn.

250
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:20,958
So, this is your hideout?

251
00:45:26,292 --> 00:45:32,502
Pretty cool.
But why bring the little kid, too?

252
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:35,673
She's useless! What's the point?

253
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:39,878
You know what your boss, Lee, told me?

254
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:42,673
Just bring the guy that he asked...

255
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,540
you talk too much.

256
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,960
Where's the little girl?!

257
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,250
Police

258
00:46:58,125 --> 00:46:59,125
hey.

259
00:47:00,917 --> 00:47:02,207
Please focus.

260
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:09,080
Romli, local resident.

261
00:47:12,667 --> 00:47:14,377
He your relation?

262
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:16,632
A friend.

263
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,458
Okay, a friend.

264
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:21,583
Now, tell me, what happened?

265
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:28,415
My friend was in the bus.
She was with them.

266
00:47:28,542 --> 00:47:30,212
Those dead people, you mean?

267
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:34,498
Yes, sir. But I didn't find her.

268
00:47:36,542 --> 00:47:40,172
She's a doctor from Jakarta,
her name's Ailin.

269
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:45,038
- Ailin.
- Yeah.

270
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:48,495
So, who killed those people then?

271
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:50,328
Go on, tell me.

272
00:47:51,042 --> 00:47:54,172
Sir, you have to believe me.

273
00:47:55,333 --> 00:47:58,633
I have to find my friend.
I have to find Ailin.

274
00:48:04,583 --> 00:48:05,583
Out.

275
00:48:18,292 --> 00:48:22,672
It's... just us now.

276
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,670
- See?
- Yes.

277
00:48:28,167 --> 00:48:29,377
Stop bullshitting me.

278
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:33,995
Or else I'll throw you
in the fucking brig.

279
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:38,457
If you know anything about me,
then go right ahead!

280
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:39,923
Do whatever you want!

281
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:43,785
But I don't have time for this.

282
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,040
Hey. Easy, easy. Relax.

283
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:54,633
Since you insist on being innocent...

284
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,710
Okay, look at this.

285
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:03,920
Do you recognize him? You know him?

286
00:49:09,167 --> 00:49:13,287
Let me refresh
your memory with a story.

287
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:15,665
This story might sound
familiar to you.

288
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:30,462
Ishmael.

289
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:37,418
There was once a rumor...

290
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:42,288
About a mysterious young man.

291
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,580
Every time he appears,

292
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:51,330
he leaves a scene of massacre
that turns the whole beach blood red.

293
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:57,875
Children, none older than 6 or 10,
would disappear as well.

294
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:02,458
Do you want to know
what happened to those children?

295
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:39,423
Those children grew up.

296
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:43,877
They were bred to become smugglers...

297
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,583
Plunderers...

298
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:49,168
And killers.

299
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:53,793
Imagine that.

300
00:50:55,125 --> 00:51:00,165
These brats have a stranglehold
on this island.

301
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:06,325
Sons of bitches.

302
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:12,168
Everyone of them willing to die...

303
00:51:13,042 --> 00:51:17,042
For their mysterious

304
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:19,495
terrorist master.

305
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:22,963
Now, one has to wonder.

306
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:26,748
Who is this person?

307
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:34,035
Even amongst criminals,
he's a terrifying figure.

308
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:40,253
Few who live to tell the tale...

309
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,040
Refer to him simply as "Lee."

310
00:51:49,042 --> 00:51:51,582
What's it got to do with me?

311
00:51:52,583 --> 00:51:54,043
Two months ago...

312
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:58,423
We hit the jackpot.

313
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:03,833
Right out of the blue,

314
00:52:04,167 --> 00:52:05,997
we found Lee,

315
00:52:06,542 --> 00:52:10,672
sitting out in the open.

316
00:52:11,917 --> 00:52:15,287
Unarmed. Unguarded.

317
00:52:16,792 --> 00:52:18,292
Imagine that.

318
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:40,833
Crazy.

319
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,790
But you see, Ishmael.

320
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,204
It gets even crazier...

321
00:52:51,229 --> 00:52:53,854
You haven't
answered my question.

322
00:53:08,417 --> 00:53:10,377
What do you say now, scum?

323
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:16,875
Listen, I really don't know...

324
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,080
Turn the lights back on!

325
00:53:45,167 --> 00:53:46,997
What the fuck is going on?

326
00:54:58,292 --> 00:54:59,292
Who are you?

327
00:55:00,417 --> 00:55:01,537
I am...

328
00:56:43,167 --> 00:56:44,167
Come on, let's go.

329
00:57:55,958 --> 00:57:57,208
Turn the power back on.

330
00:58:11,083 --> 00:58:12,503
Abdi...

331
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:03,625
Three.

332
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:06,458
Four.

333
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:38,583
Hiding? Where the fuck are you?

334
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:41,208
I still wanna play.

335
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,710
Ah, fuck. Not bad...

336
01:05:32,875 --> 01:05:34,075
bro.

337
01:05:36,292 --> 01:05:37,292
Hey, bro.

338
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:48,375
Wanna know what I did
to that bitch of yours?

339
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:53,173
Fuck you!

340
01:07:03,208 --> 01:07:05,498
So, you're the one? Abdi's savior.

341
01:07:07,292 --> 01:07:08,882
What is he to you?

342
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:13,165
A good name, Abdi.

343
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:17,170
It's supposed to mean loyalty.

344
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:22,785
Who are you?

345
01:08:25,792 --> 01:08:27,212
Don't kill him.

346
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:30,628
Tell him we got his woman.

347
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:34,083
Tejo?

348
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:36,543
I'm still here.

349
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:39,285
And I'll be coming.

350
01:08:50,667 --> 01:08:53,667
You still remember your father,
right, Abdi?

351
01:08:58,583 --> 01:08:59,583
Lee.

352
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:03,495
That's my boy.

353
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:08,883
Ailin!

354
01:09:13,125 --> 01:09:14,455
- Ishmael.
- Ailin!

355
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:18,420
- Lee! Let her go!
- You hear that?

356
01:09:58,344 --> 01:10:01,044
You should have stabbed here.

357
01:10:01,068 --> 01:10:03,068
I thought... you are a doctor?

358
01:14:11,542 --> 01:14:12,752
Do you remember it now?

359
01:14:13,708 --> 01:14:15,628
All the memories from that fucking place?

360
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:22,383
You remember, right?
He threw us into that well.

361
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:27,665
It's what separates him
from other scum.

362
01:14:28,917 --> 01:14:30,877
He took us from our parents.

363
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:34,498
He taught us how to survive
and how to kill.

364
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:39,923
Days, even weeks, without food.
Without water.

365
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:45,880
Yet... it's that very suffering
that turned us into brothers.

366
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:07,332
That's not how it ends though.

367
01:15:10,125 --> 01:15:11,125
Yeah.

368
01:15:11,917 --> 01:15:15,287
A bottle of water could turn
desperate kids into murderers.

369
01:15:24,542 --> 01:15:27,632
Hence, the father from hell.

370
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:32,788
If you know all about it,
why are you still on his side?

371
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:37,125
Everyone has to choose a side.
Following that fucker is my fate.

372
01:15:38,792 --> 01:15:42,672
You have a new lease on life.
Why are you here?

373
01:15:43,625 --> 01:15:45,825
Back off and I'll let you live.

374
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:47,417
Besi...

375
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:50,540
I can't back off now.

376
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:53,250
All this for the doctor?

377
01:15:56,417 --> 01:15:58,997
Like you said,
everyone has to choose a side.

378
01:16:05,542 --> 01:16:07,712
This won't be as easy as Tejo or Tano.

379
01:19:08,958 --> 01:19:10,078
Well done, Abdi.

380
01:19:11,542 --> 01:19:12,882
Now comes the final drill.

381
01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:07,833
Abdi...

382
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:33,500
Besi was always on your side.

383
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:35,495
And this is how
you repay him?

384
01:21:40,625 --> 01:21:42,625
You're tearing us apart, Abdi!

385
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:11,995
Remember me, Abdi?

386
01:22:24,875 --> 01:22:27,165
Or should I call you Ishmael?

387
01:22:28,667 --> 01:22:29,827
Where's Ailin?

388
01:22:31,333 --> 01:22:32,503
Take me to her.

389
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:44,038
I don't know which
makes me sadder,

390
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:47,460
watching you
killing your own...

391
01:22:50,875 --> 01:22:52,745
Or seeing the sorry
state you're in now.

392
01:22:55,875 --> 01:22:57,625
Do you know
how close we were?

393
01:23:02,958 --> 01:23:04,748
Why does it have to change, Abdi?

394
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,710
Probably because you put
a bullet in my head.

395
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,670
You betrayed father, right?

396
01:23:20,292 --> 01:23:22,082
If you ask me to choose...

397
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:26,455
You know whom
I would choose.

398
01:23:27,875 --> 01:23:28,915
Rika...

399
01:23:30,292 --> 01:23:34,632
This has been going for far too long.
I don't wanna kill anymore.

400
01:23:39,417 --> 01:23:42,127
So, it's all about her, right?

401
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,878
Leave Ailin out of this.

402
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:59,290
Since you want her that bad...

403
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:01,125
Rika!

404
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:13,750
Rika.

405
01:25:50,875 --> 01:25:51,955
That's enough, rika.

406
01:27:14,625 --> 01:27:15,625
Rika.

407
01:27:17,917 --> 01:27:18,917
That's enough.

408
01:27:45,458 --> 01:27:48,918
Remember this place?
We trained here as kids.

409
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:55,583
Even then, I always admired you, Abdi.

410
01:27:57,833 --> 01:27:59,883
Those were the happiest moments.

411
01:28:00,667 --> 01:28:01,787
Listen to me.

412
01:28:03,375 --> 01:28:05,075
You can get away from Lee.

413
01:28:07,833 --> 01:28:09,463
You have the choice to be free.

414
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:29,333
Rika.

415
01:29:25,875 --> 01:29:27,205
Rika, no...

416
01:29:32,417 --> 01:29:33,537
Now...

417
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,880
We're even.

418
01:29:44,583 --> 01:29:45,583
Rika.

419
01:30:41,958 --> 01:30:43,208
I remember everything.

420
01:30:44,667 --> 01:30:46,667
You raised us to be wolves.

421
01:30:48,875 --> 01:30:50,625
All we were good for was killing.

422
01:30:53,808 --> 01:30:55,808
It was meant to make you all stronger.

423
01:30:56,833 --> 01:30:57,923
Maybe so.

424
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,920
But it's all apparent now.

425
01:31:00,708 --> 01:31:03,168
You're neither a legend, nor a father.

426
01:31:05,375 --> 01:31:08,667
Just an old man
who bullies little kids.

427
01:31:10,542 --> 01:31:12,082
In the end you made a mistake.

428
01:31:14,406 --> 01:31:19,306
Okay, why don't you just come home?

429
01:31:19,625 --> 01:31:20,955
We'll settle this.

430
01:31:22,417 --> 01:31:23,577
I'm already here.

431
01:31:33,958 --> 01:31:36,168
Hurry! Hurry!

432
01:31:40,042 --> 01:31:41,752
Go hide in the corner.

433
01:31:44,042 --> 01:31:45,792
Where's the key?

434
01:31:57,292 --> 01:31:58,332
Get up.

435
01:31:59,792 --> 01:32:01,082
Come on, get up.

436
01:32:02,792 --> 01:32:03,792
Turn around.

437
01:32:04,292 --> 01:32:06,292
- Why?
- I said, turn around!

438
01:32:30,542 --> 01:32:31,542
Stay still!

439
01:32:58,417 --> 01:32:59,627
Fucking bitch!

440
01:33:36,583 --> 01:33:38,133
You're both dead!

441
01:33:52,333 --> 01:33:54,793
Bitch! You can't even shoot.

442
01:33:59,208 --> 01:34:00,628
No, wait! Drop it!

443
01:34:22,333 --> 01:34:23,583
Let's get the hell out.

444
01:34:37,667 --> 01:34:39,957
Let's go. Let's go.

445
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,210
This way.

446
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:43,788
What was that?

447
01:36:08,833 --> 01:36:09,923
Ailin.

448
01:36:11,458 --> 01:36:12,578
It's me.

449
01:36:27,125 --> 01:36:28,165
Ailin?

450
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:33,920
Ailin, are you all right?

451
01:36:38,292 --> 01:36:39,332
Ailin...

452
01:36:41,792 --> 01:36:43,462
I'm so sorry.

453
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:49,960
- Are you hurt bad?
- Shut up!

454
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:57,290
Ailin, please calm down.

455
01:36:58,958 --> 01:37:02,418
Get out of the way! We're leaving.

456
01:37:03,833 --> 01:37:05,253
Yes, we will leave.

457
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,080
You're one of them.

458
01:37:17,292 --> 01:37:19,042
You are exactly like them!

459
01:37:23,125 --> 01:37:24,125
Yes.

460
01:37:26,375 --> 01:37:27,455
You're right.

461
01:37:30,125 --> 01:37:32,915
Everything that I've done
to get away from them...

462
01:37:35,667 --> 01:37:38,787
Brought me to this day,
this very second.

463
01:37:49,125 --> 01:37:50,785
You saved me before.

464
01:37:54,458 --> 01:37:58,288
I need you to save me one more time.

465
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,040
Ishmael...

466
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,000
Wake up! Wake up!

467
01:39:32,024 --> 01:39:34,024
Why you look over there?

468
01:39:34,048 --> 01:39:36,048
Look at me.

469
01:39:37,072 --> 01:39:39,272
I said look at me!

470
01:39:39,796 --> 01:39:41,796
I'm your father!

471
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:49,020
You...

472
01:39:49,044 --> 01:39:51,044
are just a fucking dog

473
01:39:51,068 --> 01:39:53,868
that doesn't know the word "obey."

474
01:40:01,125 --> 01:40:02,205
Where's Rika?

475
01:40:08,792 --> 01:40:09,882
Is she dead?

476
01:40:13,625 --> 01:40:14,705
You killed her?

477
01:40:25,583 --> 01:40:27,043
She died a long time ago.

478
01:40:28,708 --> 01:40:30,918
From the moment
you pulled her out of that well.

479
01:40:31,958 --> 01:40:34,538
All of them died
when you first laid your hands on them.

480
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:40,262
Why? Why all this? What for?

481
01:40:40,286 --> 01:40:43,286
You're my son Abdi!

482
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:45,310
My son!

483
01:40:45,625 --> 01:40:46,625
Abdi?

484
01:40:54,249 --> 01:40:57,049
For everytime you call me by that name.

485
01:41:14,973 --> 01:41:16,973
So be it.

486
01:44:08,472 --> 01:44:10,472
My son...

487
01:44:12,697 --> 01:44:19,497
You know, raising you
was my greatest mistake.

488
01:44:19,521 --> 01:44:22,321
And I have to pay for it.

489
01:44:28,445 --> 01:44:32,445
And so for you...

490
01:44:32,458 --> 01:44:33,538
Abdi.

491
01:46:20,708 --> 01:46:21,748
Lee!

492
01:49:03,958 --> 01:49:04,958
Ishmael.

493
01:49:06,292 --> 01:49:07,292
Ishmael.

494
01:49:07,917 --> 01:49:08,957
Ishmael.

495
01:49:09,458 --> 01:49:10,998
Don't close your eyes, ishmael.

496
01:49:16,083 --> 01:49:18,133
Ishmael. Just look at me.

497
01:49:19,958 --> 01:49:21,828
Ishmael. Ishmael.

498
01:49:27,333 --> 01:49:29,043
Don't leave me.

499
01:52:06,458 --> 01:52:08,128
This feels familiar.

500
01:52:09,958 --> 01:52:11,378
So, how's Jakarta?

501
01:52:16,958 --> 01:52:18,878
At least the bed's better this time.

502
01:52:25,708 --> 01:52:28,078
Just wait until you get out.

503
01:52:32,375 --> 01:52:34,035
You've experienced nothing yet.

504
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:38,790
So, please...

505
01:52:42,583 --> 01:52:45,043
Don't make me wait
another two months this time.

506
01:52:47,292 --> 01:52:48,292
Okay?

507
01:52:49,833 --> 01:52:50,833
Okay?

508
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,080
(PATIENT DIAGNOSIS)

509
01:54:22,208 --> 01:54:23,498
you should write...

510
01:54:27,125 --> 01:54:28,415
Ishmael.
